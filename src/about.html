    <h1 class="text-center mb-4 vt323">About Me</h1>

    <h2 class="vt323">How I got into computers</h2>
    <p class="text-small">
      I started programming after taking a robotics class in high school, where we had to program a robot to drive
      around a course, among other projects.
      I enjoyed the feeling of getting something to work after messing around with the code and started to learn more
      programming on my own time.
      The first thing I learned was web development because it was easy to create something that I could show to my
      friends.
      I also took part in <a class="vt323" href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">CyberPatriot</a>, a national
      cybersecurity competition, while in high school where I learned about
      networking and security. I was introduced to Linux during this competition and it is now my main operating system.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 vt323">Education</h2>
    <p class="text-small">
      I am currently studying Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton.
      I started my studies as a Business Administration major, but I had already been into programming since high school
      so I decided to change my major to Computer Science my sophomore year. I love to learn computer related topics
      outside of school and am always learning something new. Many times when I take a course at school, I find that I
      have already learned the topic on my own before.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 vt323">Skills</h2>
    <p class="text-small">
      I have experience with frontend and backend development, as well as some experience with data science and machine
      learning.
      I have worked with Python, JavaScript, Flask, NextJS, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL. I am also comfortable with Linux
      and the command line.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 vt323">Interests</h2>
    <p class="text-small">
      I am interested in all aspects of software engineering, data science, and machine learning. I love to learn new
      things and am always
      looking for new projects to work on. Outside of computers, I enjoy watching and collecting movies.
      I currently have about 60 movies in my Blu-ray collection and am always looking to add more.
      I also enjoy running and try to run a least 2 miles every day.
    </p>
